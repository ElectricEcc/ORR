# Welcome to ORR

Here at ORR we believe that all classes of racing are good classes of racing. Thats why we run various different leagues on Project Cars 2. Despite all of these different leagues, running at different times on different days, we know that a strong community promotes growth and improvements to the individuals it involves. It is due to this family that we have our [Main Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XZpX5BSYwW) along with servers for each of our divisions.


## ORR IndyCar

A fan-favourite league of our is the IndyCar Championship. It races at many famous racetracks across the United States of America, capturing the passion and essence of high-speed, high-octane racing. Season 1 is coming to an end so now is the perfect time to sign up for season 2 in the [ORR IndyCar Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sUJAfYfn2y)! 


## ORR Touring Car Championship

Season 2 is **HERE!**
This championship provides an entirely different challenge for the drivers and is a challenge to see who comes out on top in some of the most tricky circuits in the world. From the local tracks of Knockhill to the staggering heights of Laguna Seca, this really is a World Championship to rival all others. See for yourself in the [ORR Touring Car Championship Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5sDZ8KmQsZ).


## LMP3 Challenge

The _newest_ member of the ORR family is the demanding LMP3 Challenge.
