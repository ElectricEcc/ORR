## Welcome to ORR

Here at ORR we believe that all classes of racing are good classes of racing. Thats why we run various different leagues on Project Cars 2. Despite all of these different leagues, running at different times on different days, we know that a strong community promotes growth and improvements to the individuals it involves. It is due to this family that we have our [Main Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XZpX5BSYwW) along with servers for each of our divisions.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ElectricEcc/ORR-Racing-Leagues/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
